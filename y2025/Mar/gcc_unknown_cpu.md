# Gcc trouble shooting #

> Unknown target CPU 'armv8-a+simd'

The error suggests that the toolchain you are using does not support ARM architectures because it defaults to targeting **x86 CPUs**. However, since you’re on a Mac (which might be running on an Apple Silicon ARM processor like M1 or M2), this is likely due to incorrect configuration of the compiler or CMake.

Here’s how to fix the problem:

---

### **Why It Happened**

The issue occurs because:
1. **The wrong target architecture is being used:** By default, Clang is targeting x86 CPUs rather than ARM CPUs, even though you're on macOS.
2. **Cross-compilation is not configured:** If you are building for Apple Silicon, you need to explicitly specify ARM64 as the target architecture in your CMake configuration.
3. **Compiler is incorrectly set:** CMake might be picking up the wrong compiler or assuming the wrong defaults.

---

### **Steps to Fix**

#### **1. Ensure Correct Compiler is Used**
Apple's Clang compiler should work for building ARM64 binaries, as it supports both x86 and ARM architectures. Ensure that `clang` is being used:

Run:
```bash
clang --version
```

You should see output similar to:
```
Apple clang version 16.0.0 (clang-1600.0.26.3)
Target: arm64-apple-darwin21.0.0
```

If the target is not `arm64`, the compiler is not set correctly.

---

#### **2. Specify the Target Architecture**

In your **CMake command**, explicitly set the target architecture to ARM64 (Apple Silicon):

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
```

- **`CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64`:** Specifies that the build should target the ARM64 architecture.
- **Alternative (for Universal Binary):**
  If you want to build for both ARM64 (Apple Silicon) and x86_64 (Intel), use:
  ```bash
  cmake -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="arm64;x86_64" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
  ```

---

#### **3. Validate and Force ARM64 Target**

If the above doesn't work, you may need to explicitly pass `-target arm64-apple-darwin` to Clang through CMake. You can achieve this by modifying the compiler flags:

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-target arm64-apple-darwin" -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-target arm64-apple-darwin" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
```

This ensures that the compiler explicitly targets the ARM64 architecture.

---

#### **4. Check the System Processor**
Make sure your Mac is running on an Apple Silicon chip (e.g., M1 or M2):

Run:
```bash
uname -m
```

- If it returns `arm64`, you are on an ARM-based Mac.
- If it returns `x86_64`, you are running on an Intel Mac.

If you are on an Intel Mac, the error happens because you’re trying to compile for ARM on hardware that doesn't support it.

---

#### **5. Check and Update Your CMakeLists.txt**

Ensure that your `CMakeLists.txt` file does not force an incompatible target architecture. For example, if you see something like this:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -march=armv8-a+simd")
```

Change it to:
```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -target arm64-apple-darwin")
```

---

#### **6. Re-run CMake with a Clean Build Directory**

If you made changes to your configuration, delete the `CMakeCache.txt` and start fresh:

```bash
rm -rf build
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64 ..
```

---

### **Verification**

1. After configuring with CMake, check that the architecture has been correctly set:
   ```bash
   grep ARCHITECTURE CMakeCache.txt
   ```
   You should see something like:
   ```
   CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES:STRING=arm64
   ```

2. Verify that the compiler is targeting ARM64:
   ```bash
   clang -v
   ```

---

### **Conclusion**

The error "unknown target CPU 'armv8-a+simd'" occurs because the wrong architecture (x86) is being targeted on a system that likely requires ARM64. By explicitly specifying the target architecture (`arm64`) using `CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES` or compiler flags, you can resolve the issue.
