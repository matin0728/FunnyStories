Guideline 2.3.1 - Performance

The app contains hidden features.


Specifically, it would be appropriate to remove any and all features in this app to load remote webview content before resubmitting for review, such as this appâ€™s JPushRichVideoMessageWebViewController.

Guideline 4.2 - Design - Minimum Functionality

Your app provides a limited user experience as it is not sufficiently different from a web browsing experience. As such, the experience it provides is similar to the general experience of using a web browser. Including features such as push notifications, Core Location, or sharing do not provide a robust enough experience to be appropriate for the App Store.


Guideline 4.3(a) - Design - Spam

We still noticed your app shares a similar binary, metadata, and concept as apps submitted to the App Store by other developers, with only minor differences.


Submitting similar or repackaged apps is a form of spam that creates clutter and makes it difficult for users to discover new apps.


Next Steps


Since we do not accept spam apps on the App Store, we encourage you to review your app concept and submit a unique app with distinct content and functionality.
