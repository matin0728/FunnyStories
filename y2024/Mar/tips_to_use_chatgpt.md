# Tips to use ChatGPT #

> Is there any directive I can use to make prompt more efficient and quickly when chat with you?

Yes, here are a few tips and "directives" you can use to make your interactions more efficient and focused when chatting with me:

---

### **1. Specify Your Goal**
Clearly state the purpose or outcome you’re trying to achieve. For example:
- **Instead of:** "How can I improve my repo size?"
- **Say:** "I want to reduce my Git repo size by moving large files to Git LFS. What are the exact steps?"

This ensures I provide focused answers without unnecessary explanations.

---

### **2. Use Keywords or Commands**
You can use shorthand or keywords to tell me what kind of response you need. Examples:
- **"Code example"**: Provide a direct code snippet.
- **"Step-by-step"**: List detailed steps for a process.
- **"Brief summary"**: Provide a concise explanation.
- **"Explain concept"**: Go into the theory or rationale behind something.

---

### **3. Contextualize Your Question**
If you’ve shared details in a previous conversation, remind me briefly so I can give a better response. For example:
- **"Continuing from my earlier repo cleanup question..."**
- **"This is related to the LFS setup we discussed."**

---

### **4. Ask for Specific Formats**
Let me know the format of the answer you want:
- **"Write in YAML format."**
- **"Give me a bash script for this."**
- **"Explain in bullet points."**
- **"Draft in plain English."**

---

### **5. Set Constraints**
If you want me to consider limits, include them in your question:
- **"Keep the response under 3 sentences."**
- **"Provide examples for Python and C++."**
- **"Assume I'm using macOS and Azure Pipelines."**

---

### **6. Highlight the Problem Scope**
Tell me what you're working on or the context:
- **"I am using Azure DevOps with Git LFS and hosting on Windows."**
- **"I am debugging a C++ build issue on Linux."**

---

### **7. Use Commands for Iterative Work**
If you're writing or editing code/documents:
- **"Review this code for optimization."**
- **"Suggest improvements to the comments."**
- **"Rewrite this for clarity."**

---

### **8. Ask Direct Questions**
Avoid general or vague queries. For instance:
- **Instead of:** "Tell me about Git."
- **Say:** "What’s the difference between `git rebase` and `git merge`?"

---

### **9. Be Technology-Specific**
Let me know what tech stack or environment you’re using:
- **"In a React Native project..."**
- **"When using CMakeLists for a C++ project..."**

---

### **10. Use Keywords for Troubleshooting**
If you're debugging, include terms like:
- **"Error message: ..."**
- **"Symbol not found: xyz."**
- **"Undefined reference in foo.a."**

This helps me focus on your exact issue.

---

### **Example Efficient Prompts**
- **Efficient:** "How do I rewrite Git history to remove a large file and migrate it to LFS?"
- **Detailed Request:** "Provide a Git command sequence to remove a 500MB file already committed, reduce repo size, and track it with LFS."
- **Code-Focused:** "Give a bash script to automate tracking large files in Git LFS."

By using these directives and tips, you can get quicker and more targeted responses!
