In a ReactNative app, write a C++ module "UploadManager", which host a singleton and can be called from native side, it has "start", "stop" method, in "start", and has responsibilities as follow instructions:

- instance method "start": Setup a timer, and execute every 30s, has a bool parameter to indicate if it is scheduled immdieatelly, otherwise trigger the timer after 30s.
- instance method "onTrigger": check "ifIsRunning" lock, and fetch records from db helper, then upload them with uploader which is a instance property, if success, delete records from local database, if all task is done or any error occurs, release the lock and wait for next trigger, and all tasks should be doen asynchronously but not maintain dedicated thread to do that, using async task.
- instance method "stop": cancel the timer.

Add other functionality necessary to meet the requirements.

# Prompt No.2 #

Assuming "uploadRecords" is an async method, and get result in the callback, please give a updated version of the code.

# Prompt No.3 #

Assume "fetchRecords" is an async method too, and add another function "deleteRecords", as a result, "fetchRecords", "uploadRecords", "deleteRecords" will execute serially, and all of them are async method, so, you do not need to make an async task to wrap them up, and only go to the next step if previous step is successed, please give a updated version of code.

If `uploadRecords` is an asynchronous method and returns its result via a callback, we need to adjust the logic so that the `onTrigger` method handles the callback properly, ensuring the task is completed only after the upload's result is received.

Here’s an updated version of the `UploadManager` code to accommodate the asynchronous `uploadRecords` method with a callback.

### `UploadManager.h`
```cpp
#pragma once

#include <memory>
#include <functional>
#include <mutex>
#include <future>
#include <atomic>
#include <chrono>
#include <vector>

class Uploader;
class DbHelper;

class UploadManager {
public:
    static UploadManager& getInstance();

    void start(bool immediate = false);
    void stop();

private:
    UploadManager();
    ~UploadManager();

    void onTrigger();
    void scheduleNext(bool immediate);
    void handleUploadResult(bool success, const std::vector<int>& records);

    std::atomic<bool> isRunning;
    std::mutex lock;
    std::unique_ptr<Uploader> uploader;
    std::unique_ptr<DbHelper> dbHelper;

    std::atomic<bool> isTimerActive;
    std::future<void> timerTask;
};
```

### `UploadManager.cpp`
```cpp
#include "UploadManager.h"
#include "Uploader.h"
#include "DbHelper.h"
#include <thread>

UploadManager& UploadManager::getInstance() {
    static UploadManager instance;
    return instance;
}

UploadManager::UploadManager()
    : isRunning(false), isTimerActive(false),
      uploader(std::make_unique<Uploader>()),
      dbHelper(std::make_unique<DbHelper>()) {}

UploadManager::~UploadManager() {
    stop();
}

void UploadManager::start(bool immediate) {
    if (isTimerActive) return;

    isTimerActive = true;
    scheduleNext(immediate);
}

void UploadManager::stop() {
    isTimerActive = false;
    if (timerTask.valid()) {
        timerTask.wait(); // Ensure the current task finishes before exiting
    }
}

void UploadManager::onTrigger() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> guard(lock);

    if (isRunning) return;
    isRunning = true;

    // Fetch records asynchronously
    std::async(std::launch::async, [this] {
        auto records = dbHelper->fetchRecords(); // Assuming fetchRecords fetches data

        if (!records.empty()) {
            // Upload records asynchronously with a callback
            uploader->uploadRecords(records, [this, records](bool success) {
                handleUploadResult(success, records);
            });
        } else {
            // No records to upload, release lock and schedule next
            isRunning = false;
            scheduleNext(false);
        }
    });
}

void UploadManager::handleUploadResult(bool success, const std::vector<int>& records) {
    // Handle the result of the upload in the callback
    if (success) {
        dbHelper->deleteRecords(records);
    }

    // Release the lock and set isRunning to false
    isRunning = false;

    // Schedule the next trigger
    scheduleNext(false);
}

void UploadManager::scheduleNext(bool immediate) {
    if (!isTimerActive) return;

    // Schedule the timer asynchronously
    timerTask = std::async(std::launch::async, [this, immediate]() {
        if (!immediate) {
            std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(30));
        }
        if (isTimerActive) {
            onTrigger();
        }
    });
}
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Asynchronous Upload with Callback**: The `uploadRecords` method now accepts a callback, which is invoked once the upload is completed.
   - The callback is captured in a lambda that passes the result (`success`) and the records to `handleUploadResult`.
2. **`handleUploadResult` Method**: This method processes the upload result in the callback:
   - If the upload succeeds, it deletes the records from the local database.
   - Regardless of success, it releases the lock (`isRunning = false`) and schedules the next trigger.
3. **Async Task Management**: The core logic remains asynchronous, where tasks are launched with `std::async` but without the creation of dedicated threads for each upload. The timer and upload logic work asynchronously using standard C++ facilities.

This design allows the upload task to be fully asynchronous and non-blocking, responding to upload completion via a callback.

If both `fetchRecords`, `uploadRecords`, and `deleteRecords` are asynchronous methods, we need to chain them sequentially. Instead of using `std::async`, we will handle the asynchronous flow directly using callbacks (or using futures/promises depending on the implementation of the async methods).

Here’s the updated version of the `UploadManager` where `fetchRecords`, `uploadRecords`, and `deleteRecords` are async methods. Each step will only proceed if the previous step was successful, and no wrapping of async tasks is needed since the functions are already asynchronous.

    void handleUploadResult(bool success, const std::vector<int>& records);
    void handleDeleteResult(bool success);

        }
        if (isTimerActive) {
            onTrigger();
        }
    });
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Chained Async Methods**: 
   - `fetchRecords`, `uploadRecords`, and `deleteRecords` are now fully async, and each function moves to the next step only if the previous one succeeded.
   - These methods use callbacks to handle the results of their respective operations.

2. **`fetchAndUpload` Method**:
   - Initiates the process by fetching records from the database asynchronously using `dbHelper->fetchRecords`.
   - If the fetch succeeds, it passes the fetched records to `handleFetchRecords` for uploading.

3. **`handleFetchRecords` Method**:
   - Handles the result of the fetch operation. If records are available, it initiates the upload process using `uploader->uploadRecords`.
   - If there are no records, it simply releases the lock and schedules the next run.

4. **`handleUploadResult` Method**:
   - Processes the result of the upload operation. If the upload succeeds, it initiates the record deletion using `dbHelper->deleteRecords`.
   - If the upload fails, it releases the lock and schedules the next run.

5. **`handleDeleteResult` Method**:
   - After deleting the records, this method releases the lock and schedules the next run.

6. **Flow Control**:
   - Each step is only triggered after the previous one completes successfully, ensuring a sequential flow of operations (fetch → upload → delete).
   - Each step runs asynchronously, but there’s no wrapping in `std::async` since the methods themselves are asynchronous.

### Benefits:
- The flow is kept clean and sequential, with each step depending on the success of the previous one.
- No unnecessary async wrapping; the asynchronous nature is handled directly within each function.
